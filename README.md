Backend which has been used for fake-product-detector product. 

As the name suggests it detects counterfeit products by scanning the bar code from the database and validate the authenticity of the product. 
Itâ€™s a full-fledged working Android application that was used to provide a demo to multiple clients but because of the lack of financial funds, we closed this idea.
